# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Sehenuk

I'm a graduate of West Chester University of Pennsylvania and a self-taught developer focused on mastering **C programming** and real-world software development practices. I'm currently working through the classic **The C Programming Language (K&R)** to sharpen my systems-level programming fundamentals.
I enjoy lifting, volunteering, building PCs, playing games, hanging with friends and famnily and also love learning new things.
