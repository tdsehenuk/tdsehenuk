# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Sehenuk

I'm a graduate of West Chester University of Pennsylvania and a self-taught developer focused on mastering **C programming** and real-world software development practices. I'm currently working through all of the exercises from the classic **The C Programming Language (K&R)** to sharpen my systems-level programming fundamentals.In addition I am working on creating, learning and studying x86_Assembly to supplement my knowledge of C and system design. When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy lifting, volunteering, building PCs, playing games, hanging with family and friends.
